# External Machines/Labs

## TryHackMe

These labs are from the [Offensive Pentesting Path](https://tryhackme.com/paths) from the time I was taking it. I did not do the Buffer Overflow and Active Directory sections. I planned to complete all the other labs in the path and then complete the [Wreath Network](https://tryhackme.com/room/wreath) and [VulnNet:Internal](https://tryhackme.com/room/vulnnetinternal). This is a bit of overkill but I wanted to finish the exam in the fastest time. So here go my writeups for these labs of different sections.

I'll be attaching writeups of all the labs I solved except for the Wreath Network.
